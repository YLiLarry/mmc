page 74, algo 2.16, precomputation of step 7 : we do not see how this
precomputation would be done in O(M(n) log(n)). If we perform an extended GCD in
step 7, the total cost of RNSToInteger climbs up to O(M(n) log(n)^2) because the
XGCD takes O(M(n) log(n)).

The only way we know to have the whole algorithm in O(M(n) log(n)) is the one
described in Modern Computer Algebra, Section 10.3 "Fast Chinese remaindering".

The precomputation only computes for all i,
r_i := [m_1 * .. * m_{i-1} * m_{i+1} * .. * m_k] mod m_i
and the modular inverses (r_i)^(-1) mod m_i in time O(M(n) log(n)).

To Flint dev team :
------------------
Similar to previous item, their precomputation costs O(M(n) log(n)^2).
